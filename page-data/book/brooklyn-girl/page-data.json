We were looking out over the sea, the horizon shining, when Anna asked the question:</p>\n<p>‘If I did something terrible,\nwould you still love me?’</p>\n<p>How would you have answered?\nAnna was the lady of my life. We were getting married in three weeks. Of course I would love her, regardless of what she had done.\nAt least that’s what I thought, but she feverishly rummaged through her bag and held out a photo to me.\n– I’m the one who did this.</p>\n<p>I gazed upon her secret, stunned, and knew that our lives had been shaken forever.\nIn my state of shock I got up and left without saying a word. When I returned it was too late: Anna had disappeared.\nAnd I’ve been looking for her ever since.</p>\n<p>A dizzying psychological thriller with a staggering ending!</p>\n<p>“Unbearable suspense!
