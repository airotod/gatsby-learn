Alice, a young Parisian cop and Gabriel, American jazz pianist, wake up on a bench in Central park hand­cuffed to one another. They don’t know each other and have no memory of having met. The night before, Alice was at a party with her girl­friends on the Champs-Elysées and Gabriel was playing piano in a club in Dublin.</p>\n<p>Impossible? And yet… So many ques­tions leave them con­founded. How did they get them­selves into such a dan­gerous sit­u­a­tion? Whose blood has stained Alice’s shirt? Why is one bullet missing from her gun?</p>\n<p>Alice and Gabriel are left with no choice but to team up to figure out what is hap­pening to them and get back to their normal lives. What they are going to dis­cover will turn their lives upside down.</p>\n<p>The finely-exe­cuted sus­pense grips you from the very first pages and will not let go.\nUnforgettable char­ac­ters, blown away by one sur­prise after another.\nAn intense, addic­tive and irre­sistible read.</p>","excerpt":"[Guillaume Musso - Central Park] Alice and Gabriel have no memory of the night before…yet they won’t forget it any­time soon.
