\[Guillaume Musso - Lost and Found]

A profoundly human story.
An astounding ending.

Layla, a five year old girl, disappears in a department store in Los Angeles. Devastated, her parents canâ€™t manage to salvage their marriage and end up separating.

Five years later, Layla is found in the exact place where she was last seen. She is alive, but strangely mute.

After the joyous reunion, come the questions. Where was Layla all these years? Who was she with? And most importantly: why is she back?
