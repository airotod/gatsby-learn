\[Guillaume Musso - Central Park]

Alice and Gabriel have no memory of the night before…yet they won’t forget it any­time soon.

New York, 8am. Alice, a young Parisian cop and Gabriel, American jazz pianist, wake up on a bench in Central park hand­cuffed to one another. They don’t know each other and have no memory of having met. The night before, Alice was at a party with her girl­friends on the Champs-Elysées and Gabriel was playing piano in a club in Dublin.

Impossible? And yet… So many ques­tions leave them con­founded. How did they get them­selves into such a dan­gerous sit­u­a­tion? Whose blood has stained Alice’s shirt? Why is one bullet missing from her gun?

Alice and Gabriel are left with no choice but to team up to figure out what is hap­pening to them and get back to their normal lives. What they are going to dis­cover will turn their lives upside down.

The finely-exe­cuted sus­pense grips you from the very first pages and will not let go.
Unforgettable char­ac­ters, blown away by one sur­prise after another.
An intense, addic­tive and irre­sistible read.
