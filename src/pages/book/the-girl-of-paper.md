\[Guillaume Musso -The girl of paper]

Can fiction influence real life? 

“She appeared on my terrace on a stormy night, soaking wet and stark naked:
– Where did you come from?
– I fell…
– Fell out of what?
– Fell out of your book. You know, out of your story!”

Tom Boyd, a famous writer who’s suffering from writer’s block, meets one day the heroin of his novels. She’s pretty, desperate, and tells him she will die if he stops writing.
Impossible? And yet…

Tom and Billie will embark together on an adventure where reality and fiction are intricately intertwined, constantly shifting in a seductive and potentially deadly game…
