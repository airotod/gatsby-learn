\[Guillaume Musso - Gone in the night]

A prestigious high school campus buried in snow.
Three friends bound by a tragic secret.
A young woman disappears in the night.

French Riviera, Winter 1992.
When her prep school is shut down by a blizzard, Vinca Rockwell, 19, one of the most gifted students in her post-baccalauréat class, runs away with her philosophy teacher with whom she has been carrying on a secret affair. For Vinca, «Love is all, or it is nothing.»
No one will ever see her again.

French Riviera, Spring 2017.
Once inseparable, Manon, Thomas and Maxime (Vinca’s best friends) haven’t spoken to each other since they finished high school. They see each other for the first time in 25 years at their high-school reunion. Back when they were students, under terrible circumstances, the three friends committed murder and hid the corpse in a wall of their high school gym. Now the gym is about to be demolished to make way for a new building. Suddenly nothing can prevent the truth from coming out.
The disturbing, painful, diabolical truth...
