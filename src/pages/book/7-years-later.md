\[Guillaume Musso - 7 years later]

Divorce separated them, danger is going to bring them back together…
From the streets of Paris to the heart of the Amazon,
an unsparing and brilliantly constructed thriller.

A bohemian artist with a fiery temper, Nikki bursts into Sebastian’s sensible and well-ordered life. Though opposites in every way, they love each other passionately. Soon after, they marry and have twins: Camille and Jeremy.
But the marriage moves quickly towards a bitter end: accusations, affairs, contempt… Hatred slowly takes the place of love in their relationship. Following a stormy divorce, each parent receives custody of one child: Sebastian provides his daughter with a very strict upbringing, while Nikki is overly lenient with her son’s misconduct.
The years go by. They both rebuild their lives, with as much distance as possible from one another.
Then one day Jeremy mysteriously disappears. Did he run away? Was he kidnapped? Nikki has no other choice but to turn to her ex-husband who she has barely seen in seven years in order to save what she holds most dear. Obliged to join forces, Nikki and Sebastian chase after their son, and regain the intimacy they had thought was lost forever.
