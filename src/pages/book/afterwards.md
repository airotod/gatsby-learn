\[Guillaume Musso - Afterwards...]

Life is for living, Life is for Love

At age 8, Nathan drowned when he jumped into a lake to save a girlâ€™s life. He went into cardiac arrest, saw a light at the end of a tunnel, and was pronounced dead. Then, against all odds, he came back to life.

Twenty years later, Nathan has become a successful lawyer in New York. Scarred by his divorce, he buries himself in his work, when a mysterious doctor suddenly appears. The time has come for him to discover, why he came back.
