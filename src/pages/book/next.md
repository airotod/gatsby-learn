\[Guillaume Musso - Next]

She is his past… he is her future.

Emma lives in New York. At age 32, she is still looking for Mr. Right. Matthew lives in Boston. He lost his wife in a terrible accident and is raising his four-year-old daughter alone.

A serendipitous e-mail encounter and correspondence leads them to believe they may finally have found happiness. Anxious to meet each other, they agree to meet in a small Italian restaurant in Manhattan.

The same day at the same time, they both push open the door to the restaurant and are shown to the same table. And yet, they never cross paths.

A game of lies? A figment of the imagination? Some form of manipulation? Caught in a form of reality beyond their comprehension, Matthew and Emma quickly come to understand that neither of them was simply stood up…

A mysterious and moving adventure.
A genius plot on the fringe of reality.
Diabolical, intense and captivating suspense.
