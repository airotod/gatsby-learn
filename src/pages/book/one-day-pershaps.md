\[Guillaume Musso - One day, pershaps]

Where there is love, there is no darkness… 

One morning, Ethan, one of Manhattan’s most brilliant therapists, receives a letter from Céline, the woman he loved, and left, in order to pursue a dazzling career. It is her wedding marriage.

Ethan is rich, famous, but terribly lonely and realizes that he lost his chance.

He has one day to fix his mistake, and win Céline back. 24 mad, and mysterious, hours, at the end of which he will be killed by a stranger.

And that is when a miracle happens: the day begins again. Ethan wakes up, in the same place, at the same time, as if destiny were giving him a second chance, to relive this decisive moment of his life.
Will he succeed, this time, in finding happiness?
