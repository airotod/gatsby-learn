\[Guillaume Musso - Will you be there?]

What if we were given a chance to go back ?

“Dad?” 
“No, Elliott, I am not your father.”
“Well then, who are you?”

The man put his hand on my shoulder. A familiar look crossed his face. He seemed to hesitate, and then answered:
“I’m you, Elliott…”

I stepped back, then froze, as if struck by lightning. The man added, “I’m you, in thirty years’ time.”
Who among us hasn’t dreamed of going back in time? Of rewriting your life, and changing your destiny?
